# CycleGan Model Overview
CycleGAN is and image-to-image translation model, just like Pix2Pix. The main challenge faced in Pix2Pix model is that the data required for training should be paired i.e the images of source and target domain should be of same location, and number of images of both the domains should also be same.

The Cycle Generative Adversarial Network, or CycleGAN, is an approach to training a deep convolutional neural network for image-to-image translation tasks. The Network learns mapping between input and output images using unpaired dataset.

# Prerequisites

#### NVIDA Development Environment
 - CUDA (= 11.1)
 - cuDNN (>= 8.x)
 - TensorRT (= 8.2.1.8)
 
    â€» You need to use .dll and .so files that match CDUA and TensorRT versions. If you want another version, Please contact [SoyNet](https://soynet.io/en/).
#### S/W
 - OS : Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
 - Others : OpenCV (for reading video files and outputting the screen)


# Parameters
 - `extend_param`
      - `batch_size` : This is the batch-size of the data you want to input.
      - `engine_serialize` : Whether or not the engine is created. (default : 0)
         - 0: Load existing engine file.
         - 1 : Create engine file from weight file. you need to set value to in following cases.
            - Change extended param.
            - Change weight file.
      - `weight_file` : The path to weight_file.
      - `engine_file` : The path to engine_file.
      - `log_file` :  The path to log_file.
      - `model_height`, `model_width` : Data size before entering the model.

# Start SoyNet Demo Examples

* Clone github repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/soynet-support/SoyNet_model_market.git
```

* download pre-trained weight files (already converted for SoyNet)

```
$ cd SoyNet_model_market/models/CycleGan/weights && bash ./download_weights.sh
```

* Run
```
$ cd ../../../samples
$ python CycleGan.py 
```

If you cannot create an engine, review the configuration settings again.

It is possible to create a C++ executable file.
