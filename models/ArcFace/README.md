# ArcFace Model Overview
Arc Face is face recognition Model.
This proposed a new loss function to improve facial recognition performance.
One of the important challenges of Feature learning using deep CNNs in Face Recognition is designing appropriate loss functions that improve discernment.

# Parameters
 - `extend_param`
      - `batch_size` : This is the batch-size of the data you want to input.
      - `engine_serialize` : [Whether or not the engine is created.](#soynet-function)
      - `cfg_file` : 
      - `weight_file` : 
      - `engine_file` : 
      - `log_file` :  
      - `model_height`, `model_width` : 
      - `model_name` :
